Differences between File System and Version Control System

1. Purpose and Function
File System:
- Manages and organizes files and directories on a storage device
- Provides basic operations like create, read, update, and delete files
- Handles file permissions and access control
- Focuses on current state of files only

Version Control System (VCS):
- Tracks changes to files over time
- Maintains history of all modifications
- Enables collaboration between multiple users
- Allows reverting to previous versions

2. Features
File System:
- Basic file operations (copy, move, rename, delete)
- Directory structure organization
- File metadata management (creation date, size, permissions)
- No built-in version tracking

Version Control System:
- Complete change history
- Branching and merging capabilities
- Conflict resolution
- Commit messages and documentation
- Remote repository support
- Collaboration tools

3. Storage
File System:
- Stores only the current version of files
- Limited to local storage device
- No inherent backup mechanism

Version Control System:
- Stores multiple versions of files
- Can be distributed across multiple locations
- Built-in backup through remote repositories

4. Collaboration
File System:
- Basic file sharing through network
- No built-in conflict resolution
- Limited concurrent access control

Version Control System:
- Multiple users can work simultaneously
- Automatic conflict detection and resolution
- Branch-based development
- Code review capabilities

5. Change Tracking
File System:
- No built-in change tracking
- Only shows current state
- Limited to file modification dates

Version Control System:
- Detailed change history
- Who made what changes and when
- Ability to compare versions
- Commit messages explain changes

6. Recovery
File System:
- Limited to system backups
- No built-in version recovery
- Deleted files are usually unrecoverable

Version Control System:
- Can restore any previous version
- Branch recovery
- Commit reversal
- Complete project history

7. Examples
File System:
- NTFS (Windows)
- ext4 (Linux)
- APFS (macOS)
- FAT32

Version Control System:
- Git
- Subversion (SVN)
- Mercurial
- Perforce
